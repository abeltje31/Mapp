# Mapp

Mapp or Move app, is a test app to learn knowledge on spring-boot, REST (HATEOS) and AngularJS.

The aim of the app itself is to keep track of items placed in moving boxes. 

To make things a little bit more interesting, I came up with the following model: items can be placed in boxes, boxes can be placed in rooms and rooms are part of a location.

In the end, it must be possible to make, modify and remove locations, rooms, boxes and items. Futuremore it must be possible to move items between boxes and boxes between rooms.
